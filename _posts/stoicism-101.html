> If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment ~ Marcus Aurelius

Founded by Zeno, in 3rd century BC, inAthens, Stoicism is a philosophy, and yet much more. Most prominent masters of stoicism included Marcus Aurelius, Cicero, Seneca, and Epictetus. 

Stoics believe that out of control emotions lead to excessive subjectivity - which in turns leads to Misjudgment. in other words, decisions clouded by emotions, almost always spell out trouble. 


stoicism values control over emotions - just like Buddhism. many people assume that both philosophies want you to be emotionles - this can not be farther from the truth. both stories I am and Buddhism want me ki to be in control of your emotions, and don't imply an emotional deficit. 

the basis of stoicism is that self-control is the foundation of weakness - which stems from too much subjectivity. 

Stoics support an attitude of calm and dispassionate handling of all situations. They think that uncontrolled emotions (especially negative ones like envy, anger, fear, and hatred), are guaranteed to cloud your judgment, and blue the mind. The subsequent incapability of objective decision making numb one's mental capacities, thus steering away from the truth. 

# Negative Visualization

Stoicism implies negative visualization. This mental, and objective, visualization of negative outcomes keeps the mind alert, and prepared for things that could go wrong. 

# Optimism is a delusion 

Stoicism does not endorse positive psychology. things don't always go as planned. Everyone is bound to underground hardship at some point. blinding yourself to words what could possibly go wrong or the negative aspects of a situation and living in a delusion of everything will be OK it's counterproductive. those who live in the delusion of excessive optimism are more vulnerable to events in which they have not prepared themselves for. 

# The business of positive thinking

Positive thinking has been a multi billion dollar business for the past couple of decades. Countless books have been written on the subject, and people pay a lot of money for a dose of positivity, in the name of personal and corporate training. in spite of the short-lived euphoria of optimism, can also make one delusional. According to Stoics, unconditional optimism is a dangerous thing. It makes you unprepared for the reality - and the reality is that life is full of hardships. or in Buddha's words life is dukha. 

Blind optimism, is quite probably, followed by sever disappointment or depression, when things don't go as you wanted. Reality seldom conforms to expectations. "Man chooses, God disposes".
