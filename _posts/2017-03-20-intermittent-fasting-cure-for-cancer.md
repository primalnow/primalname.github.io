In 1922 Professor Arnold Ehret completed his [Mucusless Diet Healing System]({% post_url 2017-03-20-prof-arnold-ehret-mucusless-diet-healing-system %}). Dr. Ehret, repeatedly insists that a 2-3 rigorous fast can trigger an unprecedented detoxing process in the body.

>Thru such an intermittent fast the blood is gradually improved, regenerated, can more easily stand the poisons and waste, and is able at the same time to dissolve and eliminate "disease deposits" from the deepest tissues of the body; deposits that no doctor ever dreamed existed, and that no other method of healing has ever discovered or can ever remove.  [Mucusless Diet Healing System]({% post_url 2017-03-20-prof-arnold-ehret-mucusless-diet-healing-system %})

Modern science has confirmed Dr. Ehret's theories, and intermittent fasting is now becoming a fad.

For practicing Muslims, the annual cycle of Ramadan fasts serve exactly the same purpose. Unfortunately, we are not careful with what we eat while starting, and ending, the Ramadan fasts. However, if one has been following the true Islamic tradition of Ramadan fasts, then you are in great luck.

Intermittent fasting starves cancer cells and leaves them vulnerable to free radical damage and ultimate destruction.

Additionally, it is said that the Prophet Muhammad (May peace be upon him), fasted every Thursday.  If you have been following this tradition as well, then according to modern science, you could be in pretty good shape.

Following Dr. Ehret's  [Mucusless Diet Healing System]({% post_url 2017-03-20-prof-arnold-ehret-mucusless-diet-healing-system %}), and the annual fasts during the holy month of Ramadan, I have completely changed my dietary habits. A predominantly [Mucusless Diet]({% post_url 2017-03-20-prof-arnold-ehret-mucusless-diet-healing-system %}), and a [non-breakfast plan]({% post_url 2017-03-20-morning-detox-drink-apple-cider-vinegar %}) has had significant effects on me physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

The subject of my new diet regimen keeps coming up in conversations with friends and family. I'm repeatedly asked to share my discoveries.

As I have mentioned in my legal disclaimer({% post_url 2017-01-01-disclaimer %}), I am not an expert, and thus not in a position to write a credible paper about such matters. But for those who are interested, I am copy-pasting highlights, and links, to relevant articles across the web.
