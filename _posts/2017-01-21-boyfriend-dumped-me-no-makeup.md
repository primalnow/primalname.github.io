<em><strong>My boyfriend dumped me because I am not like other girls who wear makeup and fashionable clothes. What should I do?</strong></em>

<em><a href="https://www.quora.com/My-boyfriend-dumped-me-because-I-am-not-like-other-girls-who-wear-makeup-and-fashionable-clothes-What-should-I-do" target="_blank">Someone asked this question on Quora</a>. Here's my answer.</em>

The fact that you asked this question, means you love him, and probably wanted to keep him. You're probably thinking "He dumped me but I want him back".

If you wanted to keep him, you should have done what was needed to stop him from leaving you for some girl who spends an hour getting dressed, every morning.

Imagine, if he insisted on walking around like a total bum didn't shave for days, or didn't iron his shirts. How would you feel? Would you have stuck with him for love?

Whether you like it or not, <a class="zem_slink" title="Physical attractiveness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">physical attraction</a> is important, especially if you're young.

If it's more important for you not to be treated like an object, or be dumped for other girls who make an effort to look good, every day, then please don't waste Quora bandwidth. The answer is simple - good riddance.
