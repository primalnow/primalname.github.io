I am just your average person trying to live a better life. It is my belief, that experiences should be shared, so others may also benefit from them.

I may not be very sure what I am - but I am quite sure what I am not. The following is a, very incomplete, list of people I don't claim to me.

- Scientist
- Doctor
- Journalist
- Religious Scholar
- Preacher
- Buddhist
- Priest

I share my experiences with matters of faith, health, beliefs, philosophy, psychology, etc.

I take full responsibility of what I say.

I take no responsibility of what you understand, from what I say.

If you:
* mimic me in any way
* follow my faith, philosophies, or practices
* eat as I do
* or even try to think like I do

And something bad happens to you, I may not be held responsible. You do whatever you do, because you want to do it - not because I asked you to do it.

I understand that there is no shortage of psychos who get pissed off ant try to kill you. So if anything I write offends anyone at all, please take for granted that it was not my intention. I tender my unconditional apology to anyone who is pissed off with anything I may have written.

If something I write is really bothering you, please just look the other way, and don't return to this blog. However, if you can't find the common sense to do that, please [let me know](/contact), and I will try to remove any text that is upsetting you enough to want to hurt me, or my family, physically.

You consume the contents of this blog, out of your own free will, and at your own risk.

Good luck.
