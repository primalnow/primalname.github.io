Lotus, the golden flower of consciousness, is a symbol of purity, awakening, reincarnation, and enlightenment.

Lotus has been an all-important symbol of creation across many religions, and cultures. In Buddhism, this flower is the representation of the essence of enlightenment.



## Lotus in ancient Egypt
Even though it is Buddhism that offers today's most popular use of the lotus symbolism, it is ancient Egypt where we see the earliest use of Lotus as a symbol of rebirth.

A text at [Dendera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera){:target="_blank"} says:

> "The Sun, which was from the beginning, rises like a hawk from the midst of its lotus bud. When the doors of its leaves open in sapphire-coloured brilliancy, it has divided the night from the day."


&nbsp;


Another text at [Dendera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera){:target="_blank"} talks of the Sun-god, Horus:

> "He opens his eyes and illuminates the world. The Gods rise from his eyes and the men from his mouth, and all things are through him, when he rises, brilliant from the lotus."


&nbsp;


A confessional chapter of the "Book of the Dead" records this invocation for the soul of the dead:

> "I am a pure lotus, issue of the field of the Sun. I guard the nostril of Ra, who guards the nostril of Hathor. I do the errands of Horus. I am a pure lotus, issue of the the field of the Sun."

For many Buddhists, the Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma, The [Lotus Sutra](http://www.cttbusa.org/lotus/lotus_contents.asp){:target='_blank'}, is the most important of all Buddhist historical texts. They believe that this sutra contains the final, and complete, teachings of Buddha - all that is needed for salvation.



The historical Buddha himself used the lotus symbolism in his sermons. Quoting from the Pali Tipitika, when Buddha was asked whether he was a god, he replied:

>"Just like a red, blue, or white lotus -- born in the water, grown in the water, rising up above the water -- stands unsmeared by the water, in the same way I -- born in the world, grown in the world, having overcome the world -- live unsmeared by the world. Remember me, brahman, as 'awakened'."



&nbsp;



Bhikku Bodhi writes in [Going for refuge & taking the precepts](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel282.html#ref8){:target='_blank'}:





> "The fourth simile compares the Buddha to a lotus flower, the paragon of beauty and purity. Just as a lotus grows up in a muddy lake, but rises above the water and stands in full splendor unsoiled by the mud, so the Buddha, having grown up in the world, overcomes the world and abides in its midst untainted by its impurities. The Buddha's teaching of the true Dhamma is like the sweet perfumed fragrance emitted by the lotus flower, giving delight to all. And the Sangha is like the host of bees who collect around the lotus, gather up the pollen, and fly off to their hives to transform it into honey."


&nbsp;


Bhikku Bodhi also writes:

> "Just as a lotus grows up in a muddy lake, but rises above the water and stands in full splendor unsoiled by the mud, so the Buddha, having grown up in the world, overcomes the world and abides in its midst untainted by its impurities."




&nbsp;



In the [Pali Tipitika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripi%E1%B9%ADaka){:target='_blank'} a poem is attributed to disciple Udayin:

> As the flower of a lotus,
Arisen in water, blossoms,
Pure-scented and pleasing the mind,
Yet is not drenched by the water,
In the same way, born in the world,
The Buddha abides in the world;
And like the lotus by water,
He does not get drenched by the world.

The color, and the stages of growth, of the lotus also have significant meanings in Buddhism.

### Color of a Lotus

- White - Purity of mind and spirit.
- Red - Compassion, and love.
- Blue - Common sense. The Blue Lotus uses Wisdom and logic to create enlightenment.
- Pink - History and historical legends of Buddha.
- Purple - Spirituality and mysticism.
- Gold - All achievement, and all enlightenment - especially in Buddha.

### Stage of growth of a Lotus

- Closed - Time before a Buddhist follower finds Buddha, or enlightenment.
- Fully Bloomed - Full enlightenment and self-awareness.

## Significance of the mud which bears the lotus

The mud, which bears the lotus, is also significant in Buddhist symbology. We are all born in a world full of suffering. All life is dukkha - suffering. It is the pain that makes us real. Without suffering there can not be enlightenment. The suffering, just like resistance in weight-training, makes us strong, and teaches us how to fight the temptation of attachment. When we free our minds from the temptation, only then are we able to rise above the muddy water, and become one with Buddha.


The lotus flower that blooms fragrantly, above murky water, is symbolic of the pure spirit which is born into the murkiness of this world, but with awareness can rise and stand freely above the mud.


> "You must be a lotus, unfolding its petals when the sun rises in the sky, unaffected by the slush where it is born or even the water which sustains it!" Sai Baba
