Please read my [Legal Disclaimer]({% post_url 2017-01-01-disclaimer %}){:target="_blank"} before reading this post.

I embarked on a journey to discover the **scientific** benefits of fasting in Islamic month of Ramadan. One of the things I discovered, was Professor Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet Healing System.

Dr. Ehret suffered from Bright's disease, which was incurable in those days. In his effort to cure himself, he discovered the benefits of intermittent fasting, and a mucus-free diet. He died 56 years old, in 1922, from a fatal blow to his skull after slipping on the road. He was 56 years old, and healthy.

"A ten minute intermission affords the family an opportunity of
talking over the PLEASANT happenings of the dayâ€” and always
bear in mind that laughter aids digestion."

Ehret claimed that pus and mucus forming foods were the reason for most human disease. He believed that the human body is an air-gas engine, which is powered exclusively by Oxygen. He theorized that a diet consisting of fruits, and green-leaf vegetables, was the perfect fuel for the human body. Ehret, also believed that intermittent fasting not only cleansed, but also rejuvenated the human body.


According to the Mucusless Diet Healing System, "All fruits, raw or cooked; also nuts and green-leaf vegetables are mucus-free." You may want to look at [Ragnar Berg's food table](https://pforlife.com/healthy-harmful-foods.html){:target="_blank"}, for a list of "good" and "bad" foods.

Dr. Ehret, insists on a "morning-fast". He says "The worst and by far the most unhealthy habit is the Heavy Break fast. No solid food should be eaten in the early morning at all if you desire to secure the best results. It is permissible to take the drink that you are accustomed to, but nothing else." Almost one hundred years later, it is becoming fashionable these days to start your day with a detoxing morning concoction.

I had struggled with a coated tongue for years. Repeated doctor consultations only proved that I had a digestive problem, but no one offered me a solution. At times it was so bad that the skin would be broken. Once, I had to use a temporary medicinal coating, just to be able to drink soup. Within a few weeks of following Dr. Ehret's dietary recommendations, my tongue turned pink - the horrible, metallic tasting, white coat was gone.  


I would also recommend a look at [modern research about intermittent fasting and the fight against disease, especially cancer]({% post_url 2017-03-20-intermittent-fasting-cure-for-cancer%}).

**I am including some quotes from the book, for encouragement.**

>I fasted for twenty-four days with such marvelously pleasing results, not only to my physical condition, but to my mental and my aspirations spiritually, that my enthusiasm increased to tell my friends and others of my discoveries, experiences and conclusive results.

>Thru such an intermittent fast the blood is gradually improved, regenerated, can more easily stand the poisons and waste, and is able at the same time to dissolve and eliminate "disease deposits" from the deepest tissues of the body; deposits that no doctor ever dreamed existed, and that no other method of healing has ever discovered or can ever remove.

> "Fasting" has been known for hundreds of years as a "compensation" against every disease, as Nature's only
and infallible law, and the same applies to the Mucusless diet; as stated in Genesis (fruits and herbs, i.e., green leaves).

>Disease is an effort of the body to eliminate waste, mucus and toxemias, and this system assists Nature in
the most perfect and natural way. Not the disease but the body is to be healed; it must be cleansed, freed from waste and foreign matter, from mucus and toxemias accumulated since childhood.

>The coated tongue is evidence of a constitutional encumbrance throughout the entire system, which obstructs and congests the circulation by dissolved mucus, and this mucus even appears in the urine.

>The worst of all eating habits nowadays is to stuff the stomach with food early in the morning.

>The worst and by far the most unhealthy habit is the Heavy Break fast. No solid food should be eaten in the early morning at all if you desire to secure the best results. It is permissible to take the drink that you are accustomed to, but nothing else.

>Never drink during a meal. If accustomed to tea or coffee, wait a short while after you have eaten before
drinking. Soups should be avoided with meals, as the more liquid taken the more difficult for proper digestion.


>Of course with the perfect mucusless diet the want and need of salt will be eliminated automatically and with that the unnatural thirst.

>I consider a light lemonade with a little honey or brown sugar or a fruit juice the best. Drink as often as you care to during the day, but in general not more than 2 or 3 quarts a day* The less you drink the more aggressive the fast works.
