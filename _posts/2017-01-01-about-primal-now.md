This is a blog about discovering God, and thus the self. About mindfulness, awareness, and consciousness.

I am on a journey to discover The Spirit of God, and I believe that the key is hidden inside all religions. A joint study of all faiths, and great philosophies, could make it possible to unlock the door to the Kingdom of Heaven.

Some would say that every religion is complete in itself, and following anyone to its spirit, is the way to achieving success. I do not agree.

I believe that the key to the great success is coded into all religions, and philosophies. However, since all of these teachings were presented to people when human intelligence was, at best, primitive, the message is not obvious. My brief study of various teachings has made it clear, that only by parallel reading, of all the texts, can one come close to understanding the hidden map for complete spiritual freedom.

Unfortunately, followers of various religions have always been clashing with each other. As a result, no one has really sat down and studied the teachings in parallel. In fact followers of all religions are so busy trying to prove each other wrong, they have forgotten that [all teachings]({% post_url 2017-02-26-chronology-of-prophets %}) were either inspired by, or directly from God.

Those who have bothered to make such a study, have not talked about it, to avoid persecution by zealots.

[The Primal Now]({% post_url 2017-01-01-what-is-primal-now %}), is my study and understanding of all teachings, in a quest to find eternal bliss.

This website is a collection of things I am learning on a day-to-day quest for a more conscious, and successful, life.

I invite you to browse through these with an open mind. I also invite an open-minded, and constructive, discourse through comments.
