All religions, and philosophies, share one common purpose at their core - Individual and collective happiness of human beings, as well as all sentient beings. The happiness of the individual and the collective is the only true purpose of life.

All scriptures, divinely inspired texts, and teachings of the greatest teachers, may differ in who to worship, and how to worship - but at their core they all want every sentient creation to be happy. What we need is an open-minded study of these texts to see beyond the obvious.

Since the beginning of recorded history, people have killed millions, in the name of faith, religion, and belief. If these warring factions had ever stood true to the philosophy, or divine instruction, whose banner they fight under, it would be clear as daylight that they were deceiving the very same edict.

But a new social consciousness is quickly emerging. With the help of the internet, we are experiencing an unprecedented interaction between people of all ideologies, and backgrounds. It is no longer possible for fake spiritual and religious leaders to rile up their followers and lead them into false wars.

This evolution, though not complete, is becoming stronger every day. Commanders who lead their followers to the destruction of happiness are now being questioned. Every ideology is being put to test.

Sure, we are still at war amongst each other, and maybe many more wars are to be fought, but for the first time, in the history of mankind, a new era of peace and happiness seems at hand.

Eckhart Tolle talks about this awakening in his book "<a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452289963/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=primalnow-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0452289963&linkId=5da8b11fff580283efbc9b7cd84e385c' target='blank'>The New Earth</a>"

Collective human consciousness and life on our planet are intrinsically connected. "A new heaven" is the emergence of a transformed state of human consciousness, and "a new earth" is its reflection in the physical realm. Since human life and human consciousness are intrinsically one with the life of the planet, as the old consciousness dissolves, there are bound to be synchronistic geographic and climatic natural upheavals in many parts of the planet, some of which we are already witnessing now.

We need to unlearn all that has been embedded in our minds, by our parents, education, media, and society. We need to become children again - evaluate, and embrace all learnings with a new spirit.
