## What is Primal?
Primal is the basic animal of mankind. It usually describes something powerful. Primal is:

* The basic instinct.
* The simplicity that was known to man in the earliest stage of evolutionary development.
* Adam and Eve before the original sin.



In the primal state, Adam and Eve were free, without the constraints of time. There was nothing but pure love, and eternity. There was no regret, or resentment, of what had been. No worry, or fear, of what will be. There was no past, or future. There was only true love, the present eternity, the continuous now.

Book of Genesis 3:21 says that after Adam and Eve had defied Him, 'The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them'.

This means that before they sinned, Adam and Eve had lived in an ethereal state. They were a part of the whole, the complete, the being, the spirit, the universe.

They then committed the original sin. A sin so great that Adam and Eve lost their heavenly state.

<blockquote>Then Satan caused them to stumble from it, and he dislodged them from what they were in; and We said, 'Get down, being enemies of one another! On the earth shall be your abode and sustenance for a time.'
<h5>Quran 2:36</h5>
</blockquote>







## What was it like in the garden of Eden?
Let’s focus on the first part 'Then Satan caused them to stumble from it, and he dislodged them from what they were in'.

They were in Eden. Adam and Eve lived in the moment, they were one with the universe.<B>There was no time. No past, no future. Just the now.</b>They had no body, and thus no ego. They had no fights with each other, no differences. They didn’t call each other nasty names, nor did they judge each other. There was no shame between them, because neither shamed the other. There was no right or wrong, no good or evil. They lived in perfect harmony with each other, and with the universe.









<h2>What happened after Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit?</h2>
And then came the evil. Satan caused them to stumble. They were dislodged from the eternal now, what they had been in. They now lived in time. There was a past, and a future. Suddenly they had egos.

<blockquote>and We said, 'Get down, being enemies of one another! On the earth shall be your abode and sustenance for a time.'
<h5>Quran 2:36</h5>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head and you will strike his heel.
<h5>Genesis 3:15</h5>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
<h5>Genesis 3:7</h5>
</blockquote>

Now they had knowledge of good and evil. Shame had come between them. Their purity and innocence was lost. They were now judging each other, because now they thought they knew what was right or wrong. They thought they knew what was good, and what was evil.




They had lived in an existence, where they were one with the universe; where there was no fighting, no differences, no right or wrong. There was just the present, the now. But suddenly right, and wrong were created. There was good, and evil.

<blockquote>but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will 'certainly die.
<h5>Genesis 2:17</h5>
</blockquote>

Once they had acquired the knowledge of good and evil, they could no longer exist with the Universe, in the Now. They had become judges, and judged. They were divided. Separated and dislodged from what they were in – the timeless and eternal now. They had lost life. They were dead.

People assume that Adam and Eve lived in the heavens, and when banished, they descended upon this tiny planet we call Earth.
<blockquote>By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the&nbsp;ground,&nbsp;since from it you were taken;&nbsp;for dust you are and to dust you will return.
<h5>Genesis 3:19</h5>
</blockquote>
But here the Bible says it clearly, that you are from the ground, and till you return to the ground, you shall suffer. God is not saying that I’m giving you life and sending you to Earth to live in. Instead He says, that when you eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall certainly die (Genesis 2:17 for when you eat from it you will certainly die).
<h2>How were Adam and Eve removed from heaven?</h2>
So how were they 'removed” from 'heaven”?










The words from the Bible make it quite clear. Before eating from the tree of knowledge, Adam and Eve were in heaven. But once they knew good and evil, they were in heaven. They went from living to dead.

They had been living in the timeless now, where there was no good, or evil. There was no shame, no judgements. There was no ego. It was heavenly. But once Adam and Eve had the knowledge of good, and evil, they actually died. They would toil, and suffer, until they returned to the ground they rose from, until they returned from the dead. When man shall become alive again, it is only then that he shall return to his origin – in unison with the universe – in the timeless now.



##  So how shall man return to life? Did God give a key?
Yes. God offers relief from the toil, and misery, that man shall suffer during his death. Quran makes it very clear:

<blockquote>'Yet, should any guidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve”
<h5>Quran 2:38</h5>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>'But those who are faithless and deny Our signs, they shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it”
<h5>Quran 2:39</h5>
</blockquote>

So Allah tells man that when I send you guidance, if you follow, you shall be free of fear and grievance. Fear is of the future, and grievance of the past. Those who do not follow, will remain in the fire. What is this fire? People think it’s the eternal fire of hell. I don’t think so.










Let’s look at 2:38 and 2:39 together. If you follow Allah’s guidance you will be free from the past and the future. When there is no past, nor future, what is left? Just the Now. The present moment. If you accept Allah’s guidance, you will not worry about the past, or the future, you will live in the Now. Those who don’t accept His guidance, will burn in the fire of fear and grievance.

The moment one accepts God’s guidance, abandons the past and the future, he will move into the eternal Now. He will once again become one with the universe. He will be resurrected, and will live again.

## How do we return to the Primal Now?

> "until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return" [Genesis 3:19]

We were taken away from the ground, we were killed, when we fell into the trap of the knowledge of good and evil. In our death we roam within this life. We burn in the fire of grievances and fears. All we need to do is to accept God’s guidance, and we shall be freed of this burning hell.

We need to abandon the past, and the future, and live in the eternal now. The now is the only truth. The past is a memory, and the future is just our imagination. Neither are real. But if you live in either of them, you will burn. Your existence will burn.

The moment you start living from now to now, which is just the continuous now, you are free.

What we need to do is to find the lost heaven. Go back to the way Adam and Eve lived, in a timeless space. Where there was no future, no past. No shame. No judgements. No good, no evil. There was just the happiness and acceptance of the now.
