Drinking Apple cider vinegar (ACV), first thing in the morning, is getting very popular these days. You could just have ACV, with some honey, in warm water every morning - or you could go into a little more detail, and enjoy the added benefits of a non-breakfast plan.

Dr. Arnold Heret, author of [Mucusless Diet Healing System]({% post_url 2017-03-20-prof-arnold-ehret-mucusless-diet-healing-system%}) says:

> The worst of all eating habits nowadays is to stuff the
stomach with food early in the morning.

> It is best that no more than two meals a day be eaten, even though the quantity you eat is as much as if three or even four meals were eaten. Later, when the stomach is cleaner, a small dish of fresh fruits when in season may be eaten for breakfast if desired. If possible, the first meal, lunch, should be eaten between ten and eleven in the morn-
ing, and supper not sooner than five or six in the afternoon.

I haver personally stopped having breakfast. I start my day with, what I call, The Morning Detox Cocktail, on an absolutely empty stomach. I take 20-30 minutes to sip the cocktail slowly.

After the morning drink, I go for a workout. In my experience, after having done this for a few months, I now have a better workout, then I did after a full breakfast.

After my workout, I drink water, and eat a 4 dates. This hydrates me, and takes care of the sugar.

On days when I don't exercise, I wait for about an hour after the ACV cocktail, before I drink some plain water

## The Morning Detox Cocktail - Recipe

- 1- Mug of water
- 1- Tablespoon honey
- 1- Tablespoon Organic Raw Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar
- 1- Teaspoon Turmeric Powder


Warm it in the microwave, just like a cup of tea - but not very hot.

The ACV,  and Turmeric, don't make for a very pleasant smell, nor taste. I sprinkle a generous amount of Cinnamon, on the warm drink. This makes the drink smell, and taste, very nice.
