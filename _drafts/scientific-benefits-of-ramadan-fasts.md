> The most exact, unerring diagnosis we have is
a short fast. The more rapidly the patient feels "worse"
thru a short fast, the greater and the more poisonous is
his encumbrance* Should be become dizzy, suffer severe

toxemias. If palpitation of the heart occurs it is a sign
that pus is somewhere in the system, or that drugs, even
though taken many years ago, are in the circulation for
elimination.  ~ ArnoldMucuslessDiet
